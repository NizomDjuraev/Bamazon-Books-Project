        Design
    </h2>
    <p>Some changes I added to my back end were adding error checking that I didn't have a chance to complete as part of
        week 1. I added some checks for my post requests to my authors handler. The author must be valid; within 1 and
        25 characters, non-existing author name, no blank inputs either. Updated the route handlers from being
        redundant. Was previously /getauthors for a get request, now updated to
        /api/authors. I added ordering by name server side as well by name for authors to maintain alphabetical
        ordering. I also changed my ID columns for authors and books. I updated them to be
        autogenerated between 1 and 1000 and to prevent manually entering in ID's. I'm not sure why I decided last week
        to manually enter ID numbers but it was just bad decision making there.
        <br>
        <br>
        I may end up restructuring the back end more if the need arises. I found that I had to do that a couple of times
        in 375 for the final project when we needed to implement some new aspect.
        The UI of my forms is just input boxes that take in for author the author name and bio. For books, the forms
        take in author id, title, publication year, and genre. The user is met with a message if the button click
        interaction is successful or not and the reason why. I implemented searching by book title using SQL syntax
        LIKE. This let me do wildcard searches where it would filter the table by whatever is entered. I thought to
        update the table when the user is typing without having to click a search button, gives a smoother experience.
        For client side validation, I checked response status that was being sent over server side and reinforced that.
        I'm not sure if that counts as client side or is still the server side validation thats carried over. The pros
        of server side is that you wouldn't be sending in all the data to the client where it is exposed, similar to
        that smart hotub example you spoke about during class.
    </p>

    <h2>
        React
    </h2>
    <p>The experience initially was cumbersome. I've gotten used to plain javascript so getting accustomed to typescript
        and react was challenging. Utilizing the useEffect hook for updating the authors table and books was tricky but
        rewarding. That being said, once I got better accustomed to using hooks, they're very useful and
        powerful. My experience using types was mainly enforcing the author and book types. It wasn't very different
        from the back-end type enforcement in terms of my experience with it. Still just getting used to it. I didn't
        have to make many manual notations, having the types in my mind made sure to stay consistent with it. I didn't
        use any types at all or tried not to. Using SPA is pretty cool seeing the changes take place live
        without any page refreshing or clicking around. The process also seems much more expedited in comparison to 375.
        Although there was a learning curve to Javascript, which I think may have played a part in being slower in 375.
        React so far seems very powerful and I'm glad I'm taking this course.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
        <b>How did you structure your API's requests and responses?</b><br>
        I structured my API's requests and responses by mostly following the RESTful principles. Each endpoint was
        designed to handle a specific type of request (GET, POST, DELETE) For example, the endpoint addtoauthors
        is
        used to add an authors to the authors table, while the endpoint getauthors is used to grab a list of all
        existing
        authors. I also made sure to include appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in the responses to
        indicate the
        status.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How did you validate inputs, what restrictions did you choose, and why?</b><br>
        I validated inputs by checking that if there weren't any fields, which would return all. If there were entered
        fields
        such as genre for the book, I added some acceptable genres which could be chosen from. I also added restrictions
        such
        as being able to only add a book if the author exists.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What edge cases did you handle and how? What edge cases did you choose not to handle?</b><br>
        I handled edge cases such as ensuring that requests to non-existent endpoints returned a 404 error for endpoints
        that dont exist
        and that requests with invalid inputs returned a 400 Bad Request response.
    </p>
    <h2>Typescript</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Keep track of the bugs Typescript helped you catch and the ones it didn't catch.</b><br>
        Typescript helped me catch bugs such as incorrect types passed as function arguments and missing required fields
        in objects. It wasn't as helpful at first when getting used to Typescript, but became more useful as I kept
        using the same types and if I
        was missing a field.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What are some of the issues Typescript helped you prevent? What are some of the holes in the type
            system?</b><br>
        Typescript helped me prevent issues such as passing the wrong type of data to a function or accessing properties
        on an object that didn't exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What kinds of values did you struggle to type correctly? Are there any Typescript topics that are still
            confusing you?</b><br>
        I didn't necessarily struggle to type anything correctly after getting used to it. There aren't any topics right
        now but I'm
        sure there will be plenty that confuse me as I keep using typescript.
    </p>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
        <b> What was your experience writing tests? Was it boring, soothing, rewarding? How did they affect your
            development process?</b>
        <br>
        Writing tests was awful. It was tedious and very error prone as there were many environment aspects I'm not used
        to and combining
        it all kept returning various errors while writing the tests. Googling around for help with the errors was
        helpful but overall
        the tests were boring and weren't very rewarding. I tested the functionality of my code as I was going through
        the functional steps
        and it was working fine. It hindered the development process in my opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Did your tests help you find any bugs? If so, which ones?</b>
        <br>
        No my tests didn't help me find any bugs. I found I ran into more bugs related to writing the tests rather than
        finding
        bugs in my code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>How would you structure your testing differently in the future? What did you learn while testing?</b>
        <br>
        I'm not sure how to go about structuring the testing differently. Maybe being exposed to more testing would be
        beneficial,
        but I'm not really sure. I learned that testing is miserable and that if done right, its a useful tool.
